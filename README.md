### Description
Functions for:
+ Binary search tree
    + recursive
    + iterative
+ Linked list
+ Double linked list
+ Queue
+ Hashtable

### Detailed specification
Logical structure, tests, data structures, libraries and prototypes of functions were made by professors at Brno University of Technology. 
My work was to write functions itself so program will pass tests.

### Usage
